Project digitizing cultural heritage

1 - previewfiles: these are for reference when prepraring the metadata and the webpage
2 - TeX files: added .gitignore for the building files as well as end-pdf since I read you should try not commiting the pdf-files and temporary files, TexStudio cleans the unwanted files, but I might forget.
3 - a table with the preliminary xlm-elements is being created.
